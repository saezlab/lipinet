# Quick Start

The general framework for LipiNet is:

1. Dataset parsing
2. Dataset exploration
3. Integration (in progress)

You can currently find tutorials for the first two steps with SwissLipids in the notebooks folder, describing the network creation process and initial findings from exploration.

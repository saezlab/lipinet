.. note::
   `LipiNet` is intended to act as an intermediary between lipidomics prior knowledge databases and network analysis packages. We aim to implement functions that are useful for many analyses, but we can't envisage every scenario either. Most of the heavy lifting in terms of network manipulation, visualisation and analysis in `LipiNet` is done by `OnionNet` and `graph-tool` on the backend. Once you have data from `LipiNet`, you may want to become familiar with these tools, or other network tools, so that you can further analyse it for your particular research question.
